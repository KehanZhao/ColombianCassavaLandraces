Regulates light-dependent repression of hypocotyl elongation and flowering time via its 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase activity. Its activity is sensitive to the redox state of its environment, decreasing under oxidative conditions and is regulated by dimerization and intra and inter-molecular disulfide bond formation.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",X,X,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","",X,"","","","","","","",X,"",""

It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress. Microarray results also suggest that transcript levels rise in response to osmotic stress, two fungal pathogens, a bacterial pathogen, and the elicitor flagellin.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",X,"",""
